Ludum Dare 36 (48H compo)

## The Trade Network
Build a trade network connecting all the villages.

### How to Play

- Click next to any village to build your first road.
- This connects the village to your trade network, increasing your income.
- To build more roads, click next to a road or a connected village.
- Villages come in three sizes. Connecting them gives you 1-3 income.
- Building roads over plains, forest, mountains or water costs 1-4 coins respectively.
- When you're out of money, press SPACE to advance to next year.
- When the year advances, you gain income from your villages, but lose coins to taxes.
- The tax rate then goes up by 2 coins.
- Connect all the villages to your road network before you are taxed into bankruptcy.
